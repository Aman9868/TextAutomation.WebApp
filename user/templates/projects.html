              Skin cancer — the abnormal growth of skin cells — most often develops on skin exposed to the sun.
                But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight.

             Plants are a major source of food for the world population.
                Plant diseases contribute to production loss, which can be tackled with continuous monitoring.
                Manual plant disease monitoring is both laborious and error-prone.

             A stop word is a commonly used word (such as “the”, “a”, “an”, “in”) that a search engine has been programmed to ignore, both when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query.
             We would not want these words to take up space in our database, or taking up valuable processing time.
              For this, we can remove them easily, by storing a list of words that you consider to stop words

            <p>
             Sarcasm detection is the task of identifying irony containing utterances in sentiment-bearing text.
                However, the figurative and creative nature of sarcasm poses a great challenge for affective computing systems performing sentiment analysis.</p>
